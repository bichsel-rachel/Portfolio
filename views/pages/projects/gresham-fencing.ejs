                    <h3>October, 2020</h3>
                    <p>This was a project that Hangar Marketing will sell to anyone insterested in the design. A previous intern had worked on this but Hangar Marketing wanted me to either build upon what was done or start from scratch. I decided that I would start this project from scratch.</p>
                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>Before any work was done, thorough research on successful fast food restaurants was conducted, especially ones that sell hamburgers. I took note of the colors they used and how they are currently doing online ordering. Next, a name was picked out for the restaurant followed by creating a logo on Adobe Illustrator. Then a digital sketch of the index page was created with Adobe XD. This laid the foundation of how the rest of the website would look and flow. The database scheme was then created before starting on the coding. Eight weeks were spent on the backend code and two weeks were spent on the CSS and frontend.</p>
