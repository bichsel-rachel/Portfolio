                    <p>Manual J&D Designers is a starter-up compnay in Idaho Falls, Idaho. They didn't have a lgor or website. The company review the HVAC that contractors are going to put into a home/building and determine if it is the correct size, layout and paower needed to cool and heat the building. I was given full creative control on this project. They didn't have any specifications on what the lgo or website should look like. I was given a list of competitors to look at. It was my job to determine was was needed on the website.</p>

                <h3>Logo</h3>
                <p>My goal for the logo was to make it unique and modern. I originally had three direction but then decided I needed another direction that didn't include a house. I decided to go more abstract to make sure this company would have a logo that would stand out. The abstract logo was the one the client ended up picking</p>

                <h3>Website</h3>
                <p>My goal for the website was to create a modern feel and have more of a white website. I wanted to avoid clutter since I noticed that a lot of HVAC websites looked crowded and cluttered with information that really didn't need to be added or could have been presented in a better way. I decided to incorporate aspects of the logo where I could to help create repetition and branding throughout the website.</p>
